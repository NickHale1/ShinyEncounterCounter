This is a small personal porject to be used as a companion program when loooking for rare "Shiny" pokemon in the Pokemon video game series
This program allows the user to keep track of how many encounters that they have had with a given pokemon while looking for it

Future Features I would Like to add
-Make the UI look nicer/ more on brand with pokemon
-Show the curretn "shiy odds" aka the chance that the next encounter will be a shiny pokemon
-Create an IOS/Android port
